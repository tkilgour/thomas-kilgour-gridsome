    <p class="mb-4">I'm Thomas, a frontend web developer. That means I build the interactive web applications and often use <a class="text-green-700 underline" href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a> to accomplish the job. I like to focus on accessibility and usability, which often means <em>less</em> is <em>more</em>. So I'll stop there.</p>
